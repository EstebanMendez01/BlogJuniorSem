## Research Project Gap:

 My research gap could be to determine the effectiveness of the game in teaching coding concepts. It is important to remember whether the game can effectively improve the coding skills of players compared to traditional methods of learning coding concepts, such as textbooks, online courses, or in person classes. Taking in consideration the engagement that the game can draw to the students by playing the game and learning new/old coding concepts to get it to perfection understanding. This can be a valuable tool for students. The gap was found by using this resources.

 With this information I came up with the research question below:
  - What is the impact of using a game-based approach to teach coding concepts for getting students motivation up and how effective is this tool?
