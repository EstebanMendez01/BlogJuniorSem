In this thought experiment, I am working on a game that helps users learn basic programming concepts of Python. The game is designed to be an interactive and engaging experience that will introduce users to key concepts of programming while keeping them entertained. It will include Game mechanics and design, Content creation, Programming (Pygame), and Testing and debugging. Currently, I have access to resources such as Python programming language, Pygame library for game development, and various software development tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and text editors. However, I still need to acquire additional resources such as learning resources for game design and mechanics, programming tutorials, and access to experienced programmers who can provide guidance and support. Finally, I imagine launching the game and seeing it being used by users to learn basic programming concepts of Python in an interactive and fun way.

## Project Feasible?
The project that I will be doing, it is feasible, because of the fact that I have done a lot of research and that I will be using familiar software that I have used in the past, or software that I can learn easily. On the other hand, the data that I need to collect will be conducted by the use of the actual game, which it is helpful to me for people to used the game.

## Software Used:
I have been thinking of doing it with python, with the library that is called pygame. On the other hand, there is another option for me to use, which is unity. Lastly, another option of software that I consider to use different than these two is a web page and create the game on HTML, JS, and some other APIs.

- JS
- Unity
- Pygame
- HTML

## Data that will be used:

Requires the use of existing data, which will be the programming concepts. This data can be obtained in some programming languages websites, documentation or youtube. The data that is in the game will be stored by gamesaves and will operate the gamesave that you have been using when chosen. The data will be secure, because it will be inside the game.
