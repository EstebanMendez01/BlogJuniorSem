This idea is about doing an app or site in which the computer science department can use it for students to review main concepts for internships, exams, meetings or for whatever they want. This would be a game in which will make it fun for people to learn.

It is about:
- Learn coding
- For students
- GBL (Game-based Learning)

Why did I choose it?
- Help others
- Interviews
